# Stock Predictor RNN
In this project I build an RNN (recurrent-neural-network) in Keras used for predicting stock prices.

I will predict stock price for few days in advance. The particular network architecture I will employ for my RNN is a  [Long Term Short Memory (LTSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory), which helps significantly avoid technical problems with optimization of RNNs.

predicts stock for few days(1-7) from stocks of previous days(5-21) using Long Short Term Memory type Recurrent Neural Networks
